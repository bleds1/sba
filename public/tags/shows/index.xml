      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a good ol&#39; run down at Coney St. but all things must come to an end. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not caught the show yet this is the final weekend coming up. This Saturday 14th from 10-5pm grab yourself a unique piece of original art, postcard, print or zine at a kind of impromptu Art Market in the space. Thanks a ton to StreetLife York for having us and check out this piece on @charleshutchpress (link below) to find out what Navigators Art are up to next.</description>
