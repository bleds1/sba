      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to posting some artwork soon. That feels long overdue and very much looking forward to it actually. Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing has been personal sketchbook study that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready for public consumption anyway to be honest. Recent times have been taken up with organising a series of local events at City Screen, Picture House in York with Navigators Art. Last month Punk/Jazz was a really fun night and a lot of folks turned out.</description>

      <description>Navigators Art &amp;amp; Performance are back in the water and making waves with a striking new exhibition and live event.&#xA;A Love Supreme or No Future? Are Punk &amp;amp; Jazz at odds or two sides of a coin? Each can be controversial, uncompromising, confrontational. The best of each is groundbreaking, pushing conventions to the limit. Both can hurt. Both can heal.&#xA;PUNK/JAZZ explores genres, contrasts and connections through music, painting, drawing, collage, print, words, sculpture and photography.</description>
