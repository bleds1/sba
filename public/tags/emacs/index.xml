      <description>So what is it? Let me introduce you because of course, there&amp;rsquo;s far too much to cover in one post. I would like to get into the more advanced stuff ideally. One of the things that annoys me is that there are a ton of &amp;ldquo;Getting Started with the Basics&amp;rdquo; types posts and videos and not enough that go deeper into the features. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve absorbed a lot of the content that&amp;rsquo;s out there, however.</description>

      <description>I used to think having Emacs on a phone was a bit much..but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve just started using Emacs and Org mode for nearly everything.. There&amp;rsquo;s not a great selection of apps on Android for accessing Org files, the best solution to me was to just get Emacs with it&amp;rsquo;s fully fledged Org on mobile. The newish GUI Android Emacs app is a bit strange and I swiftly uninstalled it.</description>

      <description>Introduction If your first thought on this is “Urrggh, really Emacs??.. Not for me..It&amp;rsquo;s ancient, bloated, complicated, full of features I don&amp;rsquo;t need..just give me a simple plain text editor“. Well that was me too. I was very much the Vim user because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a minimilist. I enjoy terminal based applications and like a lean setup. Actually - I still Vim all the time, especially for quick edits.</description>
