      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked to record someones short performance at a gig on my phone. I obliged of course but I&amp;rsquo;ve got to admit dealing with video footage on phones is not all that fun to me. Mostly because of the huge file sizes. Then we&amp;rsquo;ve got to work out how we&amp;rsquo;re going to transfer it to a computer for some post processing and send it on. The piece of video in question was around 5 gigs in size. You take this on an Android phone with Google Photos or something and that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty nasty chunk out of your free storage allowance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
