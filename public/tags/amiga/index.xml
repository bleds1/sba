Those graphics, loading screens, the box art and the music was an incredible multimedia experience at the time. Cartoons and comics had a similar role in firing me up but I will always have a soft spot for the charms of the Amiga and the late 80&amp;rsquo;s and early 90&amp;rsquo;s. I spent a lot of time thumbing through those plastic cases of copied Floppy disks with mysterious names scrawled on their labels. Each felt like a journey into a little world of imagination. The Amiga graphics might seem primitive now but the amount of creativity loaded into these little disks was insane to me. I still emulate the Amiga today and probably get more of a dopamine boost from the nostalgia than I do more modern day games. I even setup my modern desktop environment to have a retro feel of those simpler times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
