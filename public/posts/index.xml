      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving Logseq a really good go since the beginning of the year. I love the way it works actually but the thing that has made me return to Obsidian is VIM. Logseq lacks decent vim motions and all of those indented bullet points are not all that useful if you want to access your markdown elsewhere. I recently discovered the project obsidian.nvim and it really bridges a gap for me.</description>

      <title>Watercolour &amp; Gouache Portraits</title>

      <description>Small studies painted with 90% watercolour and a little white Gouache. The white Gouache just helps for a few opaques and highlights and you can veer away from the more traditional watercolour technique of leaving your white highlights as untouched paper. Trying to get back into the flow of regular daily painting and watercolour is very easy to just pick up and dive right into. I have oil paintings on the go but it takes a little bit more cognitive load and resistance to get into that process.</description>

      <description>Watched Pet Sematary 1989 again recently and was quite struck by the face of Judd Crandall aka Fred Gwynne aka Herman Munster. Those Zelda scenes still creep me out. Quite often I need a bit of escapism from this crazy old techno future we find ourselves in and a slightly crappy 80&amp;rsquo;s/90&amp;rsquo;s movie seems to hit just the right spot.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m working with oils at the moment and this horrific thing keeps happening whereby I think something&amp;rsquo;s starting to look pretty decent so I take a photo.</description>

      <description>Close ups crops of the Shelby brothers from Peaky Blinders. I painted these lads in oils &amp;amp; colour pencil on paper. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally excepted that you can quite reasonably paint with oils on paper in a sketchbook. Sometimes it can feel like a big block of resistance - the idea that we have to stretch, prime and prepare a surface or canvas for working with oil. It&amp;rsquo;s not really the case.</description>

      <description>So what is it? Let me introduce you because of course, there&amp;rsquo;s far too much to cover in one post. I would like to get into the more advanced stuff ideally. One of the things that annoys me is that there are a ton of &amp;ldquo;Getting Started with the Basics&amp;rdquo; types posts and videos and not enough that go deeper into the features. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve absorbed a lot of the content that&amp;rsquo;s out there, however.</description>

      <description>Little oil studies of elderly folk. I seem to be quite drawn to studying older faces. Cracks and wrinkles, a gnarlier texture seems more absorbing to me. These painting are no more than 5 or so inches tall and intended to be quick studies I don&amp;rsquo;t spend too much time over. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda nice to have a sheet of little studies..when you get stuck on one or need to wait for something to dry you can jump across to another and keep engaged with painting.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to posting some artwork soon. That feels long overdue and very much looking forward to it actually. Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing has been personal sketchbook study that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel ready for public consumption anyway to be honest. Recent times have been taken up with organising a series of local events at City Screen, Picture House in York with Navigators Art. Last month Punk/Jazz was a really fun night and a lot of folks turned out.</description>

      <description>Navigators Art &amp;amp; Performance are back in the water and making waves with a striking new exhibition and live event.&#xA;A Love Supreme or No Future? Are Punk &amp;amp; Jazz at odds or two sides of a coin? Each can be controversial, uncompromising, confrontational. The best of each is groundbreaking, pushing conventions to the limit. Both can hurt. Both can heal.&#xA;PUNK/JAZZ explores genres, contrasts and connections through music, painting, drawing, collage, print, words, sculpture and photography.</description>

      <description>Head practice. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a tough time with hair-do&amp;rsquo;s and beards. I can get absolutely lost in them sometimes and never feel like the painting is finished. Much like real hair do&amp;rsquo;s I suppose, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to set a time limit on how long you can fiddle around with it and then just move on and get out the house.&#xA;Related Girl Study in Krita&#xA;The North Water</description>

      <description>I ended up taking this Joe Strummer sketch to a painting with Paynes Grey Watercolour and white Gouache. Unfortunately the paper got all chewy, which is unusual because this was on some very decent Hahnemuhle stuff. You may not be able to tell from the scan. There&amp;rsquo;s some parts I&amp;rsquo;d like to fix but I got to a point where it feels like I overcooked it, loaded it with too much water and indecision at some point.</description>

      <description>I used to think having Emacs on a phone was a bit much..but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve just started using Emacs and Org mode for nearly everything.. There&amp;rsquo;s not a great selection of apps on Android for accessing Org files, the best solution to me was to just get Emacs with it&amp;rsquo;s fully fledged Org on mobile. The newish GUI Android Emacs app is a bit strange and I swiftly uninstalled it.</description>

      <description>Doing little studies like this can really take the pressure off from the bigger or more important pieces. These are about 5 inch tall and I try..&amp;rsquo;try&amp;rsquo; to not spend too long on each. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend working small and moving on quickly if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to build a daily habit.&#xA;Related Posts Oil Studies of Elders&#xA;Nora Durst&#xA;Shelby Brothers in Oil&#xA;Tooty Pipey Fella</description>

      <description>Introduction If your first thought on this is “Urrggh, really Emacs??.. Not for me..It&amp;rsquo;s ancient, bloated, complicated, full of features I don&amp;rsquo;t need..just give me a simple plain text editor“. Well that was me too. I was very much the Vim user because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a minimilist. I enjoy terminal based applications and like a lean setup. Actually - I still Vim all the time, especially for quick edits.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a good ol&amp;rsquo; run down at Coney St. but all things must come to an end. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not caught the show yet this is the final weekend coming up. This Saturday 14th from 10-5pm grab yourself a unique piece of original art, postcard, print or zine at a kind of impromptu Art Market in the space. Thanks a ton to StreetLife York for having us and check out this piece on @charleshutchpress (link below) to find out what Navigators Art are up to next.</description>

      <description>I can see there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of work to do on this. It&amp;rsquo;s a really small piece so the hair on Newt is particularly stressing me out. I will probably put it aside for a while and return to it later. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking that I&amp;rsquo;m making Ripley look like Michael Jackson.&#xA;Related Posts Small Gouache People&#xA;Village Elder</description>

      <description>Really enjoying these Evergreen Filberts and Flats from Rosemary and Co Brushes They’re synthetic, soft and springy. May not be totally clear in the pic but they have green fibres and hold a good shape. I keep ‘em in good condition by suspending them in baby oil between painting sessions.&#xA;Related Posts Female Head in Oils&#xA;Shelby Brothers in Oils&#xA;Them Oil Study</description>
