      <description>I used to think having Emacs on a phone was a bit much..but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve just started using Emacs and Org mode for nearly everything.. There&amp;rsquo;s not a great selection of apps on Android for accessing Org files, the best solution to me was to just get Emacs with it&amp;rsquo;s fully fledged Org on mobile. The newish GUI Android Emacs app is a bit strange and I swiftly uninstalled it. The Termux terminal version however, works much better.</description>

      <description>Doing little studies like this can really take the pressure off from the bigger or more important pieces. These are about 5 inch tall and I try..&amp;lsquo;try&amp;rsquo; to not spend too long on each. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend working small and moving on quickly if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to build a daily habit.</description>

      <description>Introduction If your first thought on this is ‚ÄúUrrggh, really Emacs??.. Not for me..It&amp;rsquo;s ancient, bloated, complicated, full of features I don&amp;rsquo;t need..just give me a simple plain text editor‚Äú. Well that was me too. I was very much the Vim user because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a minimilist. I enjoy terminal based applications and like a lean setup. Actually - I still Vim all the time, especially for quick edits.</description>
