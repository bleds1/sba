        Close ups crops of the Shelby brothers from Peaky Blinders. I painted these lads in oils &amp; colour pencil on paper. I think I&rsquo;ve finally excepted that you can quite reasonably paint with oils on paper in a sketchbook. Sometimes it can feel like a big block of resistance - the idea that we have to stretch, prime and prepare a surface or canvas for working with oil. It&rsquo;s not really the case.

        So what is it? Let me introduce you because of course, there&rsquo;s far too much to cover in one post. I would like to get into the more advanced stuff ideally. One of the things that annoys me is that there are a ton of &ldquo;Getting Started with the Basics&rdquo; types posts and videos and not enough that go deeper into the features. It feels like I&rsquo;ve absorbed a lot of the content that&rsquo;s out there, however.

        Little oil studies of elderly folk. I seem to be quite drawn to studying older faces. Cracks and wrinkles, a gnarlier texture seems more absorbing to me. These painting are no more than 5 or so inches tall and intended to be quick studies I don&rsquo;t spend too much time over. It&rsquo;s kinda nice to have a sheet of little studies..when you get stuck on one or need to wait for something to dry you can jump across to another and keep engaged with painting.

        I&rsquo;ll be back to posting some artwork soon. That feels long overdue and very much looking forward to it actually. Most of what I&rsquo;ve been doing has been personal sketchbook study that doesn&rsquo;t feel ready for public consumption anyway to be honest. Recent times have been taken up with organising a series of local events at City Screen, Picture House in York with Navigators Art. Last month Punk/Jazz was a really fun night and a lot of folks turned out.
