        The Amiga was an essential part of my art journey.
The art I saw as a kid on the first computer we had was a huge part in me wanting to become an artist. Those graphics, loading screens, the box art and the music was an incredible multimedia experience at the time. Cartoons and comics had a similar role in firing me up but I will always have a soft spot for the charms of the Amiga and the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s.

        I&rsquo;ve been giving Logseq a really good go since the beginning of the year. I love the way it works actually but the thing that has made me return to Obsidian is VIM. Logseq lacks decent vim motions and all of those indented bullet points are not all that useful if you want to access your markdown elsewhere. I recently discovered the project obsidian.nvim and it really bridges a gap for me.
