We are live! New HIDDEN TREASURES exhibition at [York Explore Library](https://exploreyork.org.uk/) as a part of the [York Festival of Ideas](https://yorkfestivalofideas.com/2023/throughout/hidden-treasures/)

Inspired by local streets and sights (though not the obvious ones!) as well as by works in York Art Gallery and elsewhere.

Open daily during library hours and free - but make sure you book for our other very special Festival events soon! üëç
