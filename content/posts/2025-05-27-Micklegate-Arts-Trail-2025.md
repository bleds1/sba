**The Micklegate Arts Trail is launching this Saturday 31st May!**

You can see the work of 35 local artists in 20+ shops, restaurants, cafes and more all over Micklegate, York! 

Chosen and hosted by the traders themselves, this is a true community event, devised by [Navigators Art ](https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart/) for the [York Festival of Ideas](https://yorkfestivalofideas.com/2025/). This year weâ€™ve added music, spoken word and art demonstrations in [The Artful Dodger Bar](https://the-artful-dodger.co.uk/), [The Falcon](https://www.thefalconyork.com/) and [The Hooting Owl Distillery](https://hootingowl.co.uk/) throughout the two weeks of the project. 

A visitor's guide with a map and events schedule is available from [Visit York](https://visityork.org/), [City Screen ](https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/city-screen-picturehouse), [York Explore](https://exploreyork.org.uk/), and participating venues along [Micklegate](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=micklegate+york&iaxm=maps). 

**LAUNCH DAY is 12 till 5 pm on SATURDAY 31st MAY.** 

Thereâ€™ll be street music, a busking poet, solo improvisations alongside the sculptures in Holy Trinity, and a demonstration of Giant Knitting in the church grounds.
