**The Micklegate Arts Trail is launching this Saturday 31st May!**

You can see the work of 35 local artists in 20+ shops, restaurants, cafes and more all over Micklegate, York! 

Chosen and hosted by the traders themselves, this is a true community event, devised by Navigators Art for the York Festival of Ideas. This year weâ€™ve added music, spoken word and art demonstrations in The Artful Dodger Bar, The Falcon and The Hooting Owl Distillery York throughout the two weeks of the project. 

A visitor's guide with a map and events schedule is available from Visit York, City Screen, York Explore, and participating venues along Micklegate. 

**LAUNCH DAY is 12 till 5 pm on SATURDAY 31st MAY.** 

Thereâ€™ll be street music, a busking poet, solo improvisations alongside the sculptures in Holy Trinity, and a demonstration of Giant Knitting in the church grounds. 

**YO UNDERGROUND**

To round things off, at 7.30pm we have the live event YO Underground, featuring new music and words by local and regional performers. This one is ticketed, and full details can be found on our events page.

**MAKING WAVES EXHIBITION** 

Thereâ€™ll also be a related art exhibition in [City Screen Picturehouse](https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/city-screen-picturehouse) from 8th June till 4th July. Entitled MAKING WAVES after this yearâ€™s festival theme, itâ€™s free and open during cinema hours.

And look out for upcoming details of Making Waves Live on June 21stâ€¦..
