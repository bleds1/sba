**Continuing on from our last sell-out show..**

The Basement Sessions returns..

**LIVE, LOCAL AND LOUD!**

**THE NEW SOLAR DRONES** - *adventurous indie band with a prog edge and inventive percussion* 

**DANAE** - *a welcome return by this spellbinding poet and actor from Mexico via York*

**FAT SPATULA** - *"transatlantic guitar racket/fat beats and greasy riffs"*

**NEO BORGIA TRIO** - *a punk/jazz riot from the University Big Band who wowed everyone in their debut show for Navigators*

**THE JAMMINGTONS EXPERIENCE** - *2-piece acoustic guitar, bass & vocals: the tales and trials of two lives*

**WILL GLITCH** - *a new young comedian from Norwich via Hull (which is quite funny already)*
