Really enjoying these Evergreen Filberts and Flats from [Rosemary and Co Brushes](https://www.rosemaryandco.com/) They’re synthetic, soft and springy. May not be totally clear in the pic but they have green fibres and hold a good shape. I keep ‘em in good condition by suspending them in baby oil between painting sessions.
