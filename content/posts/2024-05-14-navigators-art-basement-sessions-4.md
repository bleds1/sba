The Basement Sessions is back! - LIVE, LOCAL AND LOUD!

The latest in our series showcasing some of the best of Alternative York's artists and performers is presented in association with the 2024 York Festival of Ideas and celebrates the power of the arts to entertain, connect, provoke, question, enrich,  inspire & change.

A thrilling line-up of music, spoken word and comedy starring:

**AMY ALBRIGHT** *"(formerly Aimee Moon) fresh comedy exploring the North–South divide and the challenges of trying to fit into either"*

**DANAE** *"Spellbinding spoken word by a performance poet and actor from Mexico, inspired by transitions both geographical and emotional*"

**KANE BRUCE** *"Unapologetically dark joking about what it REALLY means to be human.."*

**ROSE DREW** *"Poet, activist, legend"*

**CAI MORIARTY** *"Haunting melodies and musings taking inspiration from such as The Beatles, Jeff Buckley, Nirvana and Radiohead"*

**JOHN PEASE** *"John returns to share his experiences and observations of the world in stand-up comedy"*

**PERCY** *"York's answer to The Fall"! Post-punk veterans of indie York, guaranteed to give a good show with new songs every time.."*
