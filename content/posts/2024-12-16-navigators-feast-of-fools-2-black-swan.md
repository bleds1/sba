[Navigators Art and Performance](https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart) Presents:


## **A FEAST OF FOOLS II**

## **Folk Music and words to Celebrate Old Christmas and Twelfth Night**

Holiday's end - the last gasp of Mischief! Welcome to our second alternative end-of-season celebration of Twelfth Night and Old Christmas: packed with live folk music, spoken word and a nod to the pagan and the impish. All at York's unique ancient Black Swan Inn @blackswanyork!

Flushed with Edinburgh Fringe success, Dr Lara McClure sets the scene with some atmospheric storytelling. We're delighted to welcome two acclaimed local musicians: Oli Collier with a walk on the dark side, and singer, guitarist and rising star Henry Parker (**** Mojo magazine). Local alt-folk legends White Sail return from last year's sold-out event with new material, as does poet and experimental musician Thomas Pearson.

Last year's show sold out, so be sure to grab your tickets before they're gone!

**Sunday 5th January 2025**

**The Black Swan, York**

7pm till 10.30pm
(Doors 6.30pm)
