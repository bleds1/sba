It's been a good ol' run down at Coney St. but all things must come to an end. If you've not caught the show yet this is the final weekend coming up. This Saturday 14th from 10-5pm grab yourself a unique piece of original art, postcard, print or zine at a kind of impromptu Art Market in the space. Thanks a ton to [StreetLife York](https://www.streetlifeyork.uk/) for having us and check out this piece on [@charleshutchpress](https://www.instagram.com/charleshutchpress/) (link below) to find out what [Navigators Art](https://linktr.ee/navigatorsart) are up to next..
