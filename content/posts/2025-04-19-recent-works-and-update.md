Not going to lie to you folks my artistic productivity has gone off the cliff.

I am in pursuit of some other priorities to try and make my life a little more stable. A little bit of sacrifice now for the greater good but honestly it feels pretty gross to not be doing art stuff. It's probably the first time in my life that I've almost put a full stop on things for a while.

I even got a new drawing tablet - a screen tablet that I will discuss setting up on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) in future posts. I figured it would be an in my face commitment that would get me back into art habits. Even that has not really been enough to make any serious work - just a little play.

Anyways when I do get back to posting work I'm primarily using [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) for my art 'portfolio' of sorts. I don't use Instagram as I hate all the Meta stuff, Pixelfed seems like my best option for posting images right now. It definitely has a little way to go as an 'app' but I think it's going to stick around and has good ethics. I particularly like that you can set up a portfolio/gallery type page. You can see that [here](https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/bledley) or at the top of this page and then click through to my profile.

I also have some ideas brewing for [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@bledleysworld) - probably more system orientated stuff as I moved to [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) and am doing all the things through [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) and [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) again. I feel I have some things to write about or make video content on there.

Including above some rough around the edges study stuff in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) that I haven't posted here yet.
