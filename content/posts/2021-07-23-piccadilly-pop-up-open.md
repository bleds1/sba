I am arting here > been so very busy working with a team of local artists on making this a successful little art space. We open to the public as a gallery every Saturday 12-6pm so swing by and say hello if you are in York. Give the insta [@piccadillypopupart](https://www.instagram.com/piccadillypopupart/) a follow if you will. An exciting project in an interesting old building provided by [@uthinkpdp](https://www.instagram.com/uthinkpdp/) which we are all very grateful for.
