[Navigators Art](https://linktr.ee/navigatorsart) are inviting submissions from visual artists based in York for our forthcoming exhibition between 10th March and 6th April 2024.

**GUNA** is a version of the ancient Greek word for 'woman' and the show forms part of the city's **International Women's Week** activities.

York Collective Navigators Art & Performance will accept submissions from **visual artists based in York** for our forthcoming exhibition at the [City Screen Picturehouse](https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/city-screen-picturehouse) gallery between 10th March and 6th April 2024.

We will also host a related live performance event of music, spoken word and comedy (independently but under the same title) in The Basement on March 23rd at 7.30 pm.

**We'd like to hear from artists (and performers too) whose work identifiably explores, promotes and celebrates the views and voices of women.** The venue requires visual art to be wall-based.

We welcome emerging and established artists equally and encourage new collaborators. Please include a link to your work online and/or examples of your previous work, and a social media link if different.

Submissions must be accompanied by a personal statement about how your work relates to the theme as well as the medium and dimensions of each piece you submit.


We are @navigatorsart on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/navigatorsart/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart/)
