Watched [Pet Sematary 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sematary_(1989_film)) again recently and was quite struck by the face of Judd Crandall aka [Fred Gwynne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Gwynne) aka Herman Munster. Those Zelda scenes still creep me out. Quite often I need a bit of escapism from this crazy old techno future we find ourselves in and a slightly crappy 80's/90's movie seems to hit just the right spot.

I'm working with oils at the moment and this horrific thing keeps happening whereby I think something's starting to look pretty decent so I take a photo..then instantly I see it with an overly critical eye that stops me from ever sharing it. Enjoyment of the creation process comes to an end I will quite often noodle all the energy out of it. It's a habit I'm trying to beat by just saying to myself I'm going to work on something for a week then post it, wish it goodbye and move on to the next thing. I'm not seeking perfection, I'm after momentum. I just finished [Rick Rubin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin) book ['The Creative Act'](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60965426) and this quote seemed to nail the kind of thing I'm thinking about right now.

>*"Releasing a work into the world becomes easier when we remember that each piece can never be a total reflection of us..If we wait, it’s no longer today’s reflection..There is a timeliness to the work. Hanging on to your work is like spending years writing the same entry in a diary. Moments and opportunities are lost. The next works are robbed of being brought to life." ~ Rubin2023*
