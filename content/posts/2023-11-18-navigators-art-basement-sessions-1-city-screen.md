I'll be back to posting some artwork soon. That feels long overdue and very much looking forward to it actually. Most of what I've been doing has been personal sketchbook study that doesn't feel ready for public consumption anyway to be honest. Recent times have been taken up with organising a series of local events at [City Screen, Picture House in York](https://www.instagram.com/cityscreenyork) with [Navigators Art](https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart). Last month [Punk/Jazz](/posts/2023-10-11-navigators-art-punk-jazz-basement-city-screen/) was a really fun night and a lot of folks turned out. Next weekend we have another installment in the form of "The Basement Sessions #1" with a nice variety of local talents taking the stage.

**LIVE, LOCAL AND LOUD!**
An adventurous mixed bill of new music (bands and solo), comedy, spoken word and more - with a few surprises up its sleeve.
All performers are local to York & area and are chosen for a spirit of experimentality and community - and of course for being excellent!
The venue is quite intimate with a mixture of standing and seated. 

**Starring:**

[What Fresh Hell](https://www.facebook.com/whatfreshhellband/) - punk/post-punk, alt rock & indie. Brilliant reviews. Catch 'em at their final gig!

[Jess Gardham](https://jessgardham.co.uk) - award-winning singer-songwriter and actor... and quarter-finalist on Masterchef!

[John Pease](https://www.instagram.com/ps_and_qs) - comedian sharing his experiences and observations of the world

[Carrieanne Vivianette](https://cvivartsfineart.wordpress.com) - spellbinding performance artist exploring the legacies of radical women through voice, movement & improvisation
