Getting the year started with a lil show alongside fellow [Navigators | @navigatorsart](https://instagram.com/navigatorsart) at [Helmsley Arts Centre](https://www.helmsleyarts.co.uk/). Huge thanks to the volunteers there who got the whole thing up and looking great with amazing speed and efficiency. **Moving Pictures II** is open until 3rd March
