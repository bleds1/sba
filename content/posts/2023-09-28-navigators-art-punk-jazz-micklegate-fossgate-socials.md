[Navigators Art & Performance](https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart) are back in the water and making waves with a striking new exhibition and live event.

*A Love Supreme or No Future? Are Punk & Jazz at odds or two sides of a coin?
Each can be controversial, uncompromising, confrontational.
The best of each is groundbreaking, pushing conventions to the limit.
Both can hurt. Both can heal.*

**PUNK/JAZZ** explores genres, contrasts and connections through music, painting, drawing, collage, print, words, sculpture and photography.

Art on show at **Micklegate & Fossgate Socials from 19th October.**
Free entry during opening hours.

**EXHIBITION LAUNCH PARTY** - New artists, new work, new venue.  Drinks, music, art.

**Sat 21st October 7 pm at [Micklegate Social](https://micklegatesocial.com)**

FREE RESERVATIONS @ [EVENTBRITE](https://bit.ly/PJ-launch)
