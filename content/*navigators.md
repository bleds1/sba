Navigators Art & Performance is a group of York-based creatives first established in 2019 and now a 12-piece collective comprising artists, writers, performers and musicians. 
Our mission is to work with community groups and projects, to enhance and creatively interpret their activities for as wide an audience as possible. 
We encourage enquiries from potential collaborators, particularly those who are less established or underrepresented.
