- Steve Beadle (@stevebeadleart) is currently a York, U.K based artist originally from Hull.
- I've spent time living in Hull, Germany, Leeds, Manchester and York in that order. 

- Studied BA Fine Art at Manchester Metropolitan University. My work during that time was concerned in the horrors of war imagery, street art and propaganda posters.
- MA in Fine Art at York St John University. My research was around Psychogeography, abstract painting, sketchbooking and mapmaking and whether the act of walking can be considered an art form.
- This time in academia left some lingering questions about how art should be taught. Most of what I have learned about 'art' has just come from a life long dedication to drawing.

- Co-founder of the group [Navigators Art and Performance](/navigators/).

- Availible for commissions if the job is right. I'm mostly asked for traditional portrait work . If I can't visit you in real life then it is important to have very good, well lit photographic reference to work from and I retain the right to refuse if I don't think we'll get a good piece out of it.
- I have some prints and postcards availible on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/stevebeadleart/) and if you see me at a market or show.
- I'll be listing some works for sale on this site with a price but many that do not have a price may still be availible for purchase or print so just shoot me a message if there's something you like.
