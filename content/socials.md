You may have noticed this is a very bare bones blog..It's an incredibly lightweight site made out of plain text markdown, html and css files. It's very much a work in progress as I learn how to code the pages and tinker with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I wanted it to be almost as minimal and distraction free as a text editor to just focus on the content. Because of this I have no tracking, comment or follow system. The best way to follow this blog is by using an RSS reader and adding the .xml link below. That's a little old school for some.. so another way to follow is to just add me on a social network and see posts when I share them or of course you could also just bookmark the page in your browser.

There is a reply by email button under every post if you have any comments or questions I am happy to answer them there. 

I post video content on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@itsbledley_tv)

My preferred social network is [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/itsbledley.bsky.social) at the moment.
