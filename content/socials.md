You may have noticed this is a very bare bones blog..It's an incredibly lightweight site made out of plain text markdown, html and css files. It's very much a work in progress as I learn how to code the pages and tinker with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I wanted it to be almost as minimal and distraction free as a text editor to just focus on the content. Because of this I have no tracking, comment or follow system. The best way to follow this blog is by using an RSS reader and adding the .xml link below. That's a little old school for some.. so another way to follow is to just add me on a social network and see posts when I share them. Of course you could also just bookmark the page in your browser.

There is a reply by email button under every post if you have any comments or questions I am happy to answer them there privately (I like email). You could also leave a comment on the social media post relating to the blog post.

I post video content on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@itsbledley_tv)

My preferred social network is probably [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@bledley)

I use [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/itsbledley) for images
