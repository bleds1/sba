You may have noticed this is a very bare bones blog..It's an incredibly lightweight site made out of plain text markdown, html and css files. It's very much a work in progress as I learn how to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

I have no tracking, comment or follow system. The best way to follow this blog is by using an RSS reader and adding the .xml link below or just bookmark the page in your browser.

There is a reply by email button under every post if you have any comments or questions I'm happy to answer them there. 

I post video content on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bledleysworld)
